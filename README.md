# Vector-calculator

I'm learning physics, and I decided to create a practical "working" vector drawer and solver.

## Known Issues:

### 1. Vector Drawing Issue When Angle is Zero:

One of the current limitations of the "Vector-calculator" is its handling of vectors with zero angles. When the angle is precisely zero degrees, the application fails to draw the vector correctly. In this case, both the x and y components of the vector should be zero. However, the existing code doesn't account for this special scenario. This issue requires further attention and code adjustments to ensure accurate vector drawing when the angle is zero.

### 2. Incorrect AB Angle Calculation:

Another issue pertains to the calculation of the angle between vectors A and B, represented as AB_angle. The current code calculates this angle inaccurately. To resolve this, a more precise approach is needed..
